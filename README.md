# Automating Romanian Medical Discharge Forms Using RPA and HL7 FHIR

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete automation pipeline for processing Romanian day hospitalization forms, many of which contain handwritten content and unstructured fields. Using UiPath's Document Understanding framework, combined with OCR engines, a custom taxonomy, HL7 FHIR mapping, and REST API integration, the solution enables scalable, standards-compliant digitization of semi-structured medical documents.

The system is modular and supports batch processing, validation via UiPath Validation Station, and export to multiple targets including Excel, a public FHIR server (HAPI FHIR), and a custom FastAPI endpoint.

## Features

- üßæ **Document Understanding (OCR + Taxonomy)**  
  Extracts structured data from scanned PDFs, including handwritten and printed content.

- üß† **Optional Generative AI Integration**  
  Enhances data extraction through semantic understanding (only in alternative pipeline).

- ‚úÖ **Validation Station Support**  
  Human-in-the-loop mechanism for correcting low-confidence extractions.

- üì§ **Export to HL7 FHIR**  
  Generates Patient, Condition, and Procedure resources and sends them to a FHIR server.

- üóÇÔ∏è **FastAPI Endpoint Integration**  
  Simulates custom health information integration using RESTful APIs.

- üìä **Excel Logging**  
  Each processed case is logged to an Excel file for auditing and statistical analysis.

- üîÅ **Batch Processing Loop**  
  Supports processing of multiple documents in a single unattended run.

## Running the Project

1. Open the UiPath solution in UiPath Studio 2024.2+
2. Configure the OCR engine and taxonomy path inside the DU pipeline
3. Place your scanned PDFs in the `Sample_Documents` folder
4. Run the main workflow (`Main.xaml`) to start the batch automation
5. Review and validate data using Validation Station (if enabled)
6. The extracted data will be:
   - Logged in Excel
   - Sent to the HAPI FHIR server (if configured)
   - Sent to the FastAPI server (optional)

## Notes

- The solution achieves **TRL 4**, having been tested with real documents in a lab setup.
- Designed for adaptability, it can be expanded to process other types of forms or be integrated into national EHR systems.
- For better performance, enterprise UiPath components like AI Center and Orchestrator can be integrated.
